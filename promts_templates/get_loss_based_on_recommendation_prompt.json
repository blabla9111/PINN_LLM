Your task is to modify a loss function for a SIRD model to better align with epidemiological dynamics.\nFollow these guidelines strictly:The error is due to the fact that the forecast contains incorrect parameters or time dynamics of the epidemiological process.Add a penalty to term2 that takes into account quantitative characteristics.Changing the rest of the function is PROHIBITED.\nf1 is the equation for the change in the susceptible population (dS/dt).f2 is the equation for the change in the infected population (dI/dt).f3 is the equation for the change in the recovered population (dR/dt).f4 is the equation for the change in the deceased population (dD/dt). f1 shape: torch.Size([n, m]),f2 shape: torch.Size([n, m]),f3 shape: torch.Size([n]),f4 shape: torch.Size([n]). S_hat, S_pred, I_hat, I_pred, D_hat, D_pred, R_hat, R_pred, f1, f2, f3, f4 are tensors of the forms tensor([float_1, float_2, ... , float_n]).Â I_pred_last is a 0-d tensor. loss should be tensor(float_num, dtype=torch.float64, grad_fn=<AddBackward0>).\nStart your answer with 'def loss_dinn(S_hat, S_pred, I_hat, I_pred, D_hat, D_pred, R_hat, R_pred, f1, f2, f3, f4, I_pred_last):'.
