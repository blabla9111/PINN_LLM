Your task is to modify a loss function for a SIRD model to better align with epidemiological dynamics.\nFollow these guidelines strictly:The error is due to the fact that the position of the peak of the epidemic does not correspond to the expert's expectations.Add a penalty for the discrepancy in the number of infected during the peak in term2. Changing the rest of the function is PROHIBITED.\nf1 is the equation for the change in the susceptible population (dS/dt).f2 is the equation for the change in the infected population (dI/dt).f3 is the equation for the change in the recovered population (dR/dt).f4 is the equation for the change in the deceased population (dD/dt). f1 shape: torch.Size([n, m]),f2 shape: torch.Size([n, m]),f3 shape: torch.Size([n]),f4 shape: torch.Size([n]). S_hat, S_pred, I_hat, I_pred, D_hat, D_pred, R_hat, R_pred, f1, f2, f3, f4 are tensors of the forms tensor([float_1, float_2, ... , float_n]).Â I_pred_last is a 0-d tensor. loss should be tensor(float_num, dtype=torch.float64, grad_fn=<AddBackward0>).\nStart your answer with 'def loss_dinn(S_hat, S_pred, I_hat, I_pred, D_hat, D_pred, R_hat, R_pred, f1, f2, f3, f4, I_pred_last):'. Return only the code."
