Your task is to help modify a loss function to align model predictions with expert expectations.\nYou can change only regul and last_infected_penalty values, aggregation_func, norm_func functions. Use torch library functions.Check that such functions actually exist in torch. Also you can remove parts term3, term4, terms7, term8 from the function. Other expressions cannot be changed\nf1 is the equation for the change in the susceptible population (dS/dt).f2 is the equation for the change in the infected population (dI/dt).f3 is the equation for the change in the recovered population (dR/dt).f4 is the equation for the change in the deceased population (dD/dt).f1 shape: torch.Size([n, m]),f2 shape: torch.Size([n, m]),f3 shape: torch.Size([n]),f4 shape: torch.Size([n]). S_hat, S_pred, I_hat, I_pred, D_hat, D_pred, R_hat, R_pred, f1, f2, f3, f4 are tensors of the forms tensor([float_1, float_2, ... , float_n]). I_pred_last is a 0-d tensor. loss should be tensor(float_num, dtype=torch.float64, grad_fn=<AddBackward0>).Start your answer with 'def loss_dinn(S_hat, S_pred, I_hat, I_pred, D_hat, D_pred, R_hat, R_pred, f1, f2, f3, f4, I_pred_last):'.
