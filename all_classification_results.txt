Comment: Too sharp a decline after the peak – in reality, the 'tail' of the epidemic should be longer.

Comment: The graph of recovered does not correspond to infected – where is the delayed immune response?

The comment mentions masks reducing the transmission rate, which would affect the number of infected over time, so it's related to the shape of the graph of the number of infected.
==================================================
Comment: Vaccination began on the 30th day – where is the smoothing of the curve in 2-3 weeks?

Comment: Quarantine measures cut off the curve too sharply – in reality, there will be a smoother decline.

==================================================
Comment: Mortality increases linearly with morbidity – but should lag behind by 1-2 weeks.

==================================================
Comment: Too many recovered in the first days – the average duration of the disease is longer.

==================================================
Comment: Asymptomatic spread is not taken into account – the actual number of infected is higher.
Error: '0'
==================================================
Comment: The graph of infected is symmetrical – in reality, the ascending and descending branches are different.

Comment: The epidemic cannot end in 60 days - usually the cycle is 3-6 months.

==================================================
Comment: Too early peak - with such measures it should be on the 40-50th day, not on the 20th.

Subclass: Based on the information provided about mortality rates, I would classify this comment as related to the Graph of the number of deceased (class 4).
==================================================
Comment: A sharp jump in mortality on the 50th day without changing the criteria for recording deaths.
